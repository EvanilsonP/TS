 - CLASS & INTERFACE -

1 - What do you mean by static method?
A static method (or static function) is a method defined as a member of an object but is accessible directly 
from an API object's constructor, rather than from an object instance created via the constructor.


2 - What is a singleton?
A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance.
