Core typescript types: number, string and boolean, object, array, tuples, Enum and any.

Tuple: A tuple is a typed array with a pre-defined length and types for each index;
Enums types: are data structures of constant length that hold a set of constant values;
Literal types: The string literal type allows you to specify a set of possible string values for a variable;

 - CLASS & INTERFACE -

1 - What do you mean by static method?
A static method (or static function) is a method defined as a member of an object but is accessible directly 
from an API object's constructor, rather than from an object instance created via the constructor.


2 - What is a singleton?
A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance.

3 - INTERFACE
an interface describes the structure of an object.

- ADVANCED TYPES -

1 Intersection types: An intersection type combines multiple types into one. This allows you to add together existing types to get a single type that has all the features you need.

2 Type guard: A type guard is a TypeScript technique used to get information about the type of a variable, usually within a conditional block

3 Type casting: Typecasting, commonly known as type conversion, is a technique for transforming one type into another in TypeScript.

4 Function overload: Method overloading is the process in which one method could be used multiple times with same name and different parameter types or return types


- DECORATORS -

What is it: A Decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter.
